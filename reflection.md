# 3.5 Your Website, part 3 Reflection

**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**
-Padding push stuff into the block, so as a result push the block boundaries away from the block content. (By block i mean div, p etc...)

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**
-I know we can push blocks all to the right, to the left and center it, and that a inline element behaves different than a block element
**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**
- Center my text

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**
- It saves a lot of work, and that a previous rule can be override but a new one.
